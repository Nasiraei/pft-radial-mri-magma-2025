## 🔍 Overview

This code implements the **recursive numerical Hankel transform**, which forms the central mathematical component of our **Polar Fourier Transform (PFT)**-based reconstruction algorithm for radially acquired 2D MRI data.

The PFT approach avoids interpolation in k-space by working in native polar coordinates. This module is designed for integration into a larger image reconstruction pipeline (e.g., Siemens ICE), but it can also be adapted for other platforms.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- `pft_core.cpp` — Core C++ implementation of the recursive Hankel transform used for radial k-space to image-space mapping
- `README.md` — This file
- `LICENSE` — MIT License for open use

> ⚠️ **Note**: This repository does *not* include Siemens ICE wrapper or integration code. To use this algorithm in a clinical scanner environment, access to Siemens ICE and a C2P agreement is required. The code here is platform-agnostic and intended for academic and research use.

## 🛠 Requirements

- C++17 or later
- Standard libraries only (no external dependencies)
- A C++ build environment (e.g., `g++`, `clang`, or MSVC)


## 🚀 Usage
This standalone module implements the Hankel transform component of PFT reconstruction. It does not perform full image reconstruction on its own. Instead, it can be:

Reviewed to understand the Hankel transform algorithm

Integrated into your own reconstruction pipeline

Adapted for use in other non-Cartesian MRI applications

✍️ Note: The current version is lightly documented. Additional comments and examples will be added in future updates.
